  <h2 class="about-h">Welcome</h2>

  <p>
    M4Brew is a simple tool for converting and organising audiobooks into clean, chapterised M4B files with AAC audio,
    making them easier to manage and more reliable for media players like Plex, Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, and similar tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s designed to remove the fiddly parts of audiobook housekeeping while staying safe, predictable, and transparent.
  </p>

  <h3 class="about-h">Folder structure (important)</h3>

  <pre class="about-tree">Audiobooks/
└── Author Name/
    └── Book Title/
        └── audio files</pre>

  <p>
    This structure is essential. It allows M4Brew to name output files consistently, generate reliable chapter titles,
    and help media managers correctly identify books and authors.
  </p>

  <h3 class="about-h">Supported input formats</h3>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>MP3 (single or multiple files)</li>
    <li>M4A (single or multiple files)</li>
    <li>Existing M4B (merged into one)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Output is always a single, chapterised <code>.m4b</code> (AAC) file.</p>

  <h3 class="about-h">Safety first</h3>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>Original audio files are never deleted automatically</li>
    <li>Converted files are created alongside your existing structure</li>
    <li>Cleanup is a separate, explicit step</li>
    <li>Jobs can be safely cancelled — no half-written files are left behind</li>
  </ul>
